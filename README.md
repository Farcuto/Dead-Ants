# Dead-Ants

This program is designed to identify a text string in which, by already established rules, it is determined if the ant is alive. If you want to obtain more information, visit the docs folder and open the file called “IDS347L Dead Ants Scenarios”.
The program has a pre-established sequence of positions of the ants which are saved in a text string in a variable called **“string”**, if you want to change the sequence you only have to modify the variable **“string”**.

## Steps to run the program (Dead Ants):
1. install the library called colorama with the following command (~~~pip install colorama~~~)
2. Modify the **“string”** variable in case you want to try a different sequence than the one
which is predetermined.
3. If you do not have python installed, visit the official website
[download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest stable version in the
download section
4. Install python if you do not have it installed.
5. restart your computer
6. open the command console and type ~~~“python”~~~ or ~~~“python3”~~~ and the file path
main.py, it should look like this ~~~python ./main.py~~~ or similar.
7. If you do not know how to write the file path, I recommend opening the terminal,
write python and drag the main.py file into the terminal window.
